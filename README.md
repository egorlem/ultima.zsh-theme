## Features

- **Multi-Line Prompt:** The prompt is divided into three lines for better readability. The first line separates the previous command's output from the prompt, the second line provides detailed path information, and the third line is for input.
- **Multiple Prompt Levels:** Configurations for secondary and tertiary prompt levels (`PS2` and `PS3`) are included.
- **SSH Status Indicator:** Displays an indicator when an SSH connection is established.
- **VCS (Version Control System) Integration:** Supports **Git**, **SVN**, and **Mercurial** for showing branch and repository status directly in the prompt.
    - **Git Integration:** Shows branch name, staged and unstaged changes, and untracked files.
    - **SVN and Mercurial Integration:** Shows branch name and repository status.
- **Completion Enhancements:** Advanced completion settings, including menu completion, caching, and various completion styles and formats.
- **LS_COLORS Configuration:** Configures `LS_COLORS` for both **BSD** and **GNU** systems to enhance directory listings.
- **LESS and MAN Configuration:** Customizes the behavior and appearance of `less` and `man` pages.

These features make `ultima.zsh-theme` a powerful and versatile theme for Z shell users, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.

## Recommended Settings and Compatibility

### Terminal and Color Scheme

For the best experience, use the **Ghostty** terminal together with the **Guezwhoz** color scheme.

**Guezwhoz** is a balanced dark color scheme designed with a focus on visual comfort and readability.  
The theme meets the WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard and is based on the principles of analogous color harmony, providing a pleasant, cohesive color experience during long terminal sessions.

**For [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) and [Wezterm](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm) users:**  
Set the color scheme to `guezwhoz` in your terminal configuration. **Guezwhoz** is bundled by default with **Ghostty** and **Wezterm**—no additional installation required.

**For other terminals:**  
You can install the **Guezwhoz** theme from the [@mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) repository.

These recommendations ensure optimal appearance and compatibility for this project. Using other terminals or color schemes may result in a different visual experience.

### Fonts

Not all fonts include the U+203A Unicode character (Single Right-Pointing Angle Quotation Mark). Unless your system font supports this character, install one of the standard fonts, such as **Arial**, **Consolas**, or **Impact**.

For comfortable work, I recommend [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).  
This font already includes all the characters used in the theme and is ideal for full compatibility.
