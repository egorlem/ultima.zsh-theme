  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

Note: 

Legal stuff can be boring, but this license isn’t! Use, share, modify, 
and most importantly, have fun! As Bukowski put it: 'An intellectual  
says a simple thing in a hard way. An artist says a hard thing in a  
simple way.' So be an artist in your code and keep it simple, yet powerful.
